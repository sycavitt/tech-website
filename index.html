  <h1>1st Website Milestone- Creation of telacommunications </h1>
  <h2>Telecommunication is the transmission of signs, signals, messages, words, writings, images and sounds or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of
    information between communication participants includes the use of technology. It is transmitted through a transmission media, such as over physical media, for example, over electrical cable, or via electromagnetic radiation through space such as
    radio or light. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing. Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange, the term
    telecommunications is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies. Telecommunications is what does everything that involves with technology transportation. It allows your text messages to be sent and it also allows for your media to be transmitted. Telecommunication involves signals and beacon and many other things. </h2>

  <h1>2nd Website Milestone- Early develoment of computers </h1>
  <h2>Although the development of digital computers is rooted in the abacus and early mechanical calculating devices, Charles Babbage is credited with the design of the first modern computer, the analytical engine, during the 1830s. Vannevar Bush
    built a mechanically operated device, called a differential analyzer, in 1930; it was the first general-purpose analog computer. John Atanasoff constructed the first electronic digital computing device in 1939; a full-scale version of the
    prototype was completed in 1942 at Iowa State College. In 1943 Conrad Zuse built the Z3, a fully operational electromechanical computer. Computers have not always what they have looked like today. Computers would take up a whole room just for one
    computer, and would be alot slower then what they are now. Computers in the early time had very large compents which made it hard for differnt places to have one, so the computers would be very rare. During WW2 a computer was created to crack
    britsh code. </h2>

  <h1>3rd Website Milestone- Laptops </h1>
  <h2>A laptop computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a "clamshell" form factor, typically having a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid of the clamshell and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside
    of the lower lid. The clamshell is opened up to use the computer. Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use. Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed to be placed on a person's lap when being used. Although
    originally there was a distinction between laptops and notebooks, the former being bigger and heavier, as of 2019, there is often no longer any difference. Laptops are commonly used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for
    playing games, Internet surfing, for personal multimedia, and general home computer use. The laptop has allowed for a revolutionary change with computers themselves. </h2>

  <h1>4th Website Milestone- Internet </h1>
  <h2>The internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the internet protocol suite to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of
    local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of
    the World Wide Web , electronic mail, and file sharing. The internet has proved helpful for the past years. The internet has allowed people to know anything in the matter of seconds. </h2>

  <h1>5th Website Milestone- Email </h1>
  <h2>Electronic mail also know as email is a method of exchanging messages "mail" between people using electronic devices. Email was invented by Ray Tomlinson, email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now
    recognized as email. Email operates across computer networks, which today is primarily the internet. Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging. Today's
    email systems are based on a store and forward model. Store and forward is someone can send something while the other person is offline, and when that person comes online then they can open the email when they want. Email servers accept, forward,
    deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect only briefly, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.
